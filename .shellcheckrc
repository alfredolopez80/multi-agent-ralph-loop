# Shellcheck configuration for Multi-Agent Ralph
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki

# Specify shell
shell=bash

# Disable specific checks that don't apply to this project

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# We source files dynamically, this is expected
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file
# External files like .bashrc, hooks/*
disable=SC1091

# SC2001: See if you can use ${var//search/replace} instead
# Sometimes sed is clearer for complex replacements
disable=SC2001

# SC2002: Useless cat
# Sometimes 'cat file | cmd' is more readable than 'cmd < file'
disable=SC2002

# SC2004: $/${} is unnecessary on arithmetic variables
# We prefer explicit ${} for consistency
disable=SC2004

# SC2015: Note that A && B || C is not if-then-else
# We know this pattern and use it intentionally
disable=SC2015

# SC2029: Note that, unescaped, this expands on the client side
# SSH commands sometimes need expansion
disable=SC2029

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Used for documentation or sourcing
disable=SC2034

# SC2120: Function references arguments that are never passed
# Functions may use $@ internally
disable=SC2120

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# We often combine for simplicity
disable=SC2155

# SC2207: Prefer mapfile or read -a to split command output
# Sometimes we want word splitting
disable=SC2207

# External sources (for following includes)
# source-path=scripts
# source-path=.claude/hooks
