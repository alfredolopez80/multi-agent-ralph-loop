# Multi-Agent Ralph Loop - Project Instructions

> **Documentation Standards**: All development documentation is in English and stored in the `docs/` directory.

## Documentation Organization

### Structure

All project documentation follows a professional folder structure under `docs/`:

```
docs/
├── context-monitoring/      # Context tracking analysis and fixes
├── architecture/            # Architecture diagrams and design docs
├── security/                # Security-related documentation
├── retrospective/           # Project retrospectives
├── examples/                # Code examples and tutorials
└── CLAUDE.md                # General documentation guidelines
```

### Creating New Documentation

When creating documentation for a new subject:

1. **Create a new folder** under `docs/` named after the subject
   - Example: `docs/feature-name/`
   - Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word subjects

2. **Use descriptive filenames**
   - `ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis and investigation documents
   - `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete fix summaries
   - `VALIDATION_vX.Y.Z.md` - Validation reports with version numbers
   - `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation guides

3. **Write in English**
   - All documentation must be in English
   - Follow standard markdown formatting
   - Include date, version, and status at the top

4. **Link related documents**
   - Add references to related documentation
   - Use relative paths for links within `docs/`

### Example Documentation Template

```markdown
# [Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Version**: vX.Y.Z
**Status**: [ANALYSIS COMPLETE | FIX REQUIRED | RESOLVED]

## Summary
[Brief description of the document purpose]

## Details
[Main content]

## References
- [Related documentation](../other-folder/file.md)
```

## Language Policy

| Content Type | Language | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Code** | English | Variables, functions, classes, comments |
| **Documentation** | English | All files in `docs/` |
| **Commit Messages** | English | Conventional commits format |
| **Code Comments** | English | Inline documentation |

## Recent Documentation Reorganization

**Date**: 2026-01-28

The following documentation files were reorganized from `.claude/` to `docs/context-monitoring/`:

- `ANALYSIS.md` - Context monitoring analysis (was `ANALYSIS_CONTEXT_MONITORING.md`)
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete fix summary (was `CONTEXT_MONITORING_FIX_SUMMARY.md`)
- `VALIDATION_v2.75.0.md` - Validation report (was `VALIDATION_REPORT_v2.75.0.md`)
- `FIX_CORRECTION_v2.75.1.md` - Fix correction analysis (was `FIX_CORRECTION_v2.75.1.md`)

This follows the project standard of storing all development documentation in the `docs/` repository with appropriate folder organization.
