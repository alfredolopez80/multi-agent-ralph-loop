# EDD (Eval-Driven Development) Framework v2.64

**Eval-Driven Development** is a quality-first development pattern that enforces **define-before-implement** workflow with structured evaluations.

## What is EDD?

EDD provides a systematic approach to software development with three phases:

1. **DEFINE** - Create structured eval specifications using TEMPLATE.md
2. **IMPLEMENT** - Build features according to eval definitions
3. **VERIFY** - Validate implementation against eval criteria

## Check Types

| Prefix | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `CC-` | Capability Checks | Feature capabilities and functionality |
| `BC-` | Behavior Checks | Expected behaviors and responses |
| `NFC-` | Non-Functional Checks | Performance, security, maintainability |

## Usage

```bash
# Invoke EDD workflow
/edd "Define memory-search feature"

# CLI script (if available)
ralph edd define memory-search
ralph edd check memory-search
```

## Components

- **TEMPLATE.md**: Template for creating eval definitions
- **edd.sh**: CLI script for eval management
- **/edd skill**: Skill invocation from Claude Code
- **~/.claude/evals/**: Directory for eval definitions

## Template Structure

Each eval definition includes:

1. **Capability Checks** (CC-) - What the feature can do
2. **Behavior Checks** (BC-) - How the feature behaves
3. **Non-Functional Checks** (NFC-) - Performance, security, etc.
4. **Implementation Notes** - Technical guidance
5. **Verification Evidence** - Test results

## Example: memory-search.md

```markdown
# Memory Search Eval

**Status**: DRAFT
**Created**: 2026-01-30

## Capability Checks
- [ ] CC-1: Search across semantic memory
- [ ] CC-2: Support filtering by type

## Behavior Checks
- [ ] BC-1: Returns ranked results
- [ ] BC-2: Handles empty queries gracefully

## Non-Functional Checks
- [ ] NFC-1: Search completes in <2s
- [ ] NFC-2: Memory usage <100MB

## Implementation Notes
- Use parallel search for performance
- Cache frequent queries

## Verification Evidence
- Test results attached
```

## Integration with Orchestrator

EDD integrates with the orchestrator workflow to ensure quality-first development:

1. **Clarify** phase - Define evals
2. **Plan** phase - Review eval requirements
3. **Implement** phase - Build to eval specs
4. **Validate** phase - Verify against evals

## Testing

Test suite: `tests/test_v264_edd_framework.bats` (33 tests)

Run tests:
```bash
bats tests/test_v264_edd_framework.bats
```

## Status

**Current**: Framework defined, minimal implementation
**Note**: Full implementation pending - TEMPLATE.md and evals directory may not exist yet

**Version**: v2.64 | **Status**: DRAFT | **Tests**: 33 passing
