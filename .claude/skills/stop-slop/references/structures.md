# Structural Patterns to Avoid

## Binary Contrasts

Forced either/or framings that feel artificial:

- "This isn't just X, it's Y"
- "It's not just about A, it's about B"
- "On one hand... on the other hand..."
- "Either X or Y (when both valid)"
- "While some may think X, others believe Y"
- "The choice between X and Y"

## Dramatic Fragmentation

Unnecessary line breaks and sentence fragments for effect:

- Short sentences after long ones just for emphasis
- Single-word paragraphs
- Bullet points that don't need bullets
- Ellipses for drama...
- Exclamation points for excitement!
- ALL CAPS for emphasis

## Rhetorical Setups

Predictable question-answer patterns:

- "So what does this mean?"
- "So why does this matter?"
- "What's the takeaway here?"
- "The answer is..."
- "You might be wondering..."
- "You may ask yourself..."
- "Let me break this down..."

## Tripling

Lists of three used as a pattern (not for genuine enumeration):

- "fast, flexible, and affordable"
- "examples, evidence, and expertise"
- "simple, straightforward, and easy"
- "today, tomorrow, and always"
- "better, faster, stronger"
- "discover, learn, grow"
- "create, innovate, inspire"

## Metronomic Endings

Sentences that all end the same way:

- Consecutive sentences all ending with the same word type
- Every paragraph starting with the same structure
- Consistent use of the same sentence starter

## Transition Overuse

Overused transition words and phrases:

- "Furthermore,"
- "Moreover,"
- "Additionally,"
- "In addition,"
- "Likewise,"
- "Similarly,"
- "On the other hand,"
- "That being said,"
- "With that said,"
- "Moving on to..."
- "Turning our attention to..."
- "Shifting gears..."
- "Now let's look at..."

## Formulaic Paragraphs

Predictable paragraph structures:

1. Topic sentence with filler
2. Examples with "for instance"
3. Conclusion with "in conclusion"

Or:

1. Problem statement
2. "This is why..."
3. Solution
4. "In short..."

## Artificial Opening Patterns

Generic ways to start documents or sections:

- "In this article, we will explore..."
- "In this guide, you will learn..."
- "In this post, I want to discuss..."
- "Today, I'm going to talk about..."
- "Over the past decade,..."
- "For years, researchers have..."
- "It's no secret that..."
- "There's a common misconception that..."

## Closing Patterns

Clichéd ways to end:

- "In conclusion..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "All things considered..."
- "Ultimately..."
- "The bottom line is..."
- "To sum up..."
- "In the final analysis..."
- "Looking to the future..."
- "The future is..."
