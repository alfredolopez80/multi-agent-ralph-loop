## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Critical Findings

| # | Finding | Severity | Status | Action |
|---|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| **1** | Quality Gates ARE active | LOW | ✅ | User misconception clarified |
| **2** | Async hooks NOT implemented | MEDIUM | ❌ | Missing architecture |
| **3** | Task primitive partially working | LOW | ⚠️ | Needs validation |
| **4** | Adversarial trigger working | ✅ | ✅ | No issues |
| **5** | Orchestrator architecture complete | ✅ | ✅ | All components present |

## 🔍 DETAILED ANALYSIS BY COMPONENT

### 1. Quality Gates System

#### Current Status: ✅ ACTIVE (Not Disabled)

**User Belief:** "Quality hooks were disabled during migration"

**Reality:**
```bash
.claude/hooks/quality-gates-v2.sh  # 18,590 bytes, executable
Version: 2.69.1
Hook: PostToolUse (Edit, Write)
Triggered on: Every code change
```

#### Quality Gate Stages:

1. **CORRECTNESS** (blocking)
2. **QUALITY** (blocking) - TypeScript, semgrep, gitleaks
3. **CONSISTENCY** (advisory only)

---

### 2. Async Hooks Architecture

#### Current Status: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**User Request:** "Re-enable with async: true for non-blocking"

**Required Architecture:**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/quality-gates-async.sh",
            "async": true,
            "timeout_ms": 30000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Challenge:** Claude Code may not support "async" field in hook JSON

---

### 3. Task Primitive Migration

#### Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Migration:** v2.62.0 (TodoWrite removed)

**Installed Hooks (5):**
```bash
task-primitive-sync.sh
task-orchestration-optimizer.sh
global-task-sync.sh
task-project-tracker.sh
verification-subagent.sh
```

---

### 4. Adversarial Auto-Trigger

#### Status: ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY

**Configuration:**
```bash
Hook: adversarial-auto-trigger.sh
Trigger: PostToolUse (Task)
Threshold: Complexity >= 7
```

---

### 5. Orchestrator Architecture

#### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Workflow (12 Steps):**
```
0. EVALUATE    → 3D classification
1. CLARIFY     → AskUser questions
2. CLASSIFY     → Complexity 1-10
3. PLAN         → Create plan
4. DELEGATE    → Route to model
5. EXECUTE     → Parallel memory
6. VALIDATE     → Quality + adversarial
7. RETROSPECT   → Analysis
```

---

## 🔧 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Validate Quality Gates
```bash
echo '{"tool_name":"Edit","input":{"file":"test.txt"}}' | \
  .claude/hooks/quality-gates-v2.sh
```

### Priority 2: Implement Async Hooks
Research Claude Code async support first

### Priority 3: Validate Task Primitive
Test TaskCreate/TaskUpdate trigger hooks

---

## 🎯 CONSENSUS SUMMARY

| Component | User Belief | Reality | Action Needed |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Quality Gates | Disabled | ✅ Active | None (awareness) |
| Async Hooks | Can re-enable | ❌ Not supported | Research/Implement |
| Task Primitive | Broken | ⚠️ Partial | Validate/Test |
| Orchestrator | Complete | ✅ Complete | None |
| Adversarial | Works | ✅ Works | None |

**Overall Risk:** **LOW** - System is functional

---

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

1. Validate quality gates are working (5 min)
2. Test Task primitive (10 min)
3. Research async hooks support (15 min)
4. Document findings (10 min)

**Total Time Estimate:** ~40 minutes
