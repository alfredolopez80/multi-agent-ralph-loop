# Adversarial Validation System

Documentation for the adversarial validation system used in Multi-Agent Ralph Loop.

## Overview

The adversarial validation system uses multiple AI models to cross-validate implementations and ensure high-quality outputs through competitive analysis.

## Documents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_ECC.md](IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_ECC.md) | Adversarial improvement plan with ECC (Error-Correcting Code) validation |
| [VALIDATION_REPORT.md](VALIDATION_REPORT.md) | Adversarial validation report documenting cross-model analysis results |
| [LEARNING_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md](LEARNING_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md) | Review of the learning system using adversarial validation techniques |

## Key Concepts

- **Cross-Model Validation**: Using multiple AI models (Claude, Codex, GLM-4.7) to validate implementations
- **Adversarial Testing**: Having models challenge each other's findings to identify edge cases
- **Quality Gates**: Validation criteria that must be met before implementation is approved
